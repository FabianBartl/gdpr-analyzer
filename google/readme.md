## How can I request my data?

According to the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), you should follow their guide on "[How to download your Google data](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190)". This help page takes you to the [Google data export](https://takeout.google.com/) form, where you can select in detail what you want to download. I recommend selecting everything except for the videos youâ€™ve uploaded to YouTube, as including them could result in a very large data package. To do this, scroll down to "YouTube and YouTube Music," click on "All YouTube data included," and uncheck "Videos." For the same reason, you might also consider deselecting "Google Drive".
